    "The central goal of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset comprising of forty soybean cultivars harvested over two consecutive seasons. The aim is to understand the factors influencing thousand seed weight (MHG) and grain yield (GY) among these cultivars, investigating seasonal changes in these metrics, and creating predictive models for estimating MHG in new cultivar types. Additionally, the project will also include cluster analysis to group similar cultivars based on their characteristics."
